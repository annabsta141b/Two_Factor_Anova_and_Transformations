# Two Factor Anova and Transformations

### Part 1: Transformation of Variables
Given data on the number of helicopters requested over different times of the day for a sheriffâ€™s office, the goal for this report is to transform the data so it best fits the ANOVA model. We will be looking at assumptions of normality and constant variance, the best transformation and if outliers must be removed using a Single Factor ANOVA model with variables Count (number of helicopters called) and Shift (I, II, III, IV).

### Part 2: Two Factor ANOVA
The goal is to build a model using data of annual salaries for Data Scientists, Software Engineers, and Bioinformatics Engineers in San Francisco and Seattle. We are using a Two Factor ANOVA approach and will test for various effects to build the  model, perform diagnostics, calculate confidence intervals and perform other statistical measures to analyze the data. 

The data for this report can be found in the data folder.
